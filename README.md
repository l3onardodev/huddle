<p>This project was developed for CSS's Bootstrap framework learning purposes.</p>
<p>The goal was to develop a landing page based on a public design published <a href="">here</a>.</p>


## Technologies used:
- Bootstrap 5
- SASS pre-processor
- HTML
- VueJS 2
- Vue Router (Altough it was not used.)
- VueCLI


## What I've learned from this project:
<p>This project helped me to understand a lot more about Bootstrap in general, emphasizing, though, how the <em>Bootstrap Grid System</em> works.</p>

<p>Beyong Bootstrap, with this project I had the chance to have more contact with SASS (technology that I am still learning), understanding how I can change bootstrap's variables values and adapt them to design I want to create.</p>
